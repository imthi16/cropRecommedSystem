# Crop Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The system provides crop suggestions based on environmental factors, potentially improving agricultural yields.
